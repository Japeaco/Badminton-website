  <h3 class="homeHeader">Welcome to the Bridlington and District Badminton Association Website</h3>

  <p>The badminton club is based at the Bridlington CYP on Gypsey Road. Whether you want to play seriously, for fun, to keep fit, or to socialise, 
  come down and join us.</p>

  <p>There are several adult clubs for those that want to compete in teams against other clubs in the league - there are currently 7 clubs registered with the league with nearly 30 teams playing in doubles format.</p>

  <p>Badminton is a great way to keep fit. We try to make it fun and we welcome anyone. If you're not sure, come down on Thursday evenings at 8pm and join us for some free games. 
  After a few weeks, you can decide whether you want to join a club or just turn up every Thursday and pay a fixed fee of £2.50 during the summer season or £4 during 
  the winter season. If you join a club, you benefit from lower fees and you can ask to join one of the teams if you want to play in the league throughout the winter months.</p>
